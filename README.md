This is a tribute game to classic 90s Amiga games, e.g. Menace and Xenon II Meglablast. It is based on the Phaser 3 framework.

**CONTROLS**

cursor keys - movement
space - fire
p - pause

**GRAPHICS**

This game is optimised to run on the following systems:
Chrome (current version)
Windows 10
Linux Kubuntu

Running on Mac has resulted in poor game performance and choppy sprite movement depending on hardware configuration.

Thanks to the wonderful GA crew, particularly Joel, John and Theo, for all their patience and assistance to get this working!
