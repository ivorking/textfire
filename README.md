GA project - textFIRE!

This is a tribute game to classic 90s Amiga games, e.g. Menace and Xenon II Meglablast.

**CONTROLS**

cursor keys - movement
space - fire
p - pause

**GRAPHICS**

This game is optimised to run on the following systems:
Chrome (current version),
Windows 10,
Linux Kubuntu

Running on Mac has resulted in poor game performance and sprite movement.

Thanks to the GA crew and staff for all their patience and assistance to get this working!
